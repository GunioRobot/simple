## A simple Drupal installation profile.

Use the simple_distro.make file to build the Drupal codebase.

`drush make simple_distro.make public_html`

This will build Drupal with a number of patches required by Build Kit and build the Simple install profile.

## Thanks

Inspired by [Build Kit](http://drupal.org/project/buildkit)
