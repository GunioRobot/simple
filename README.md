## A simple Drupal distibution.

Use the simple_distro.make file to build the Drupal codebase.

`drush make simple_distro.make public_html`

This will build Drupal with a number of patches required by Build Kit and build the Simple distribution.

The included simple_config module is currently nothing more than a placeholder.

## Thanks
